# How to Fly a Plane (Sort Of)

Disclaimer: This is not actual flight instruction. Please seek proper training before attempting to fly any aircraft!

## The Dream of Flight

Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by aviation. The idea that humans figured out how to soar through the sky in metal machines still amazes me. While I'm not a licensed pilot (yet!), I've been learning about the basics of aviation.

## Basic Principles

Flying a plane involves understanding four fundamental forces:
1. **Lift** - The upward force created by the wings
2. **Weight** - Gravity pulling the aircraft down
3. **Thrust** - The forward force from the engines
4. **Drag** - Air resistance opposing motion

## The Cockpit

Modern aircraft cockpits are incredibly complex, filled with instruments that monitor everything from altitude to fuel consumption. But at its core, the basic controls are:
- The yoke or stick (controls pitch and roll)
- Rudder pedals (controls yaw)
- Throttle (controls engine power)

Maybe one day I'll actually get my pilot's license. Until then, I'll keep dreaming and learning!
