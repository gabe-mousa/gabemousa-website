# Building this personal website and my blog

Hi, this is my website and my blog.

I never thought that I would end up having something like this but as time went on I felt more and more of that draw to create something which had some sort of tangible progress and as I work on making a transition to learning and studying more about AI research, I wanted a random outlet for the flow of my thoughts. 

So I guess this is it.

We'll see if more comes, whether that be blog posts, edits and updates to this website, or anything else for that matter.

Now when it came to building this website, it's been a fun little journey and frankly only took a few hours. I am hosting it on GitHub Pages, and a majority of the construction was done by Claude using Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5 models based on the task I was working on. It's primarily javascript to generate the dynamic ocean and while it took some hours of tinkering around and a couple of manual interventions and code adjustments, color me impressed by the quality of the output. Anyways, here's to more to come!
